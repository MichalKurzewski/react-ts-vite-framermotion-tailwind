# React ts init project with tailwind framer-motion vitest-ts

My initial project boilerplate as of 2023.02.21:  

- react 18.2.0
- ts
- tailwind
- framermotion
- vitest
- tanstack/axios useFetch in hooks folder - if no querying is needed remove this file and these two libraries from packages.
- react router - if no routing needed just remove the library otherwise wrap the app with the client provider and describe routes to use links as per react router docs https://reactrouter.com/en/main
